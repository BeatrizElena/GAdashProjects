## Build a CSS Robot

1. Use border properties to create a head with an antenna, a torso and a foot on a robot.
  - Divs are empty, it's the borders of the divs that create the shapes.

2. Animate the robot using CSS positioning
  - We're no longer relying on <code>margin: 0 auto;</code> to center the robot on the page.
  - Intro to Cartesian coordinates: the X, Y, an Z coordinates.
  - <code>position: relative;</code> vs <code>position: absolute;</code>
      -- Intro to 4 new properties: top, right, bottom and left.
      -- <code>left</code> works like the X axis; i.e. declares how far something is from the left of its container.
      -- <code>top</code> like the Y axis; i.e. declares how far something is from the top of its container.

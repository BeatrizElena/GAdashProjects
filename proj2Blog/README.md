## Build a Blog
Build a Responsive Blog Theme by:

1. Making an HTML header that includes an image and navigation links.

2. Using the article tag for each post and creating an HTML "like" button.

3. Styling the header and other HTML elements with CSS.

4. Adding a JQuery event listener to the "like" button.
